# HC-12 Notes
These are some useful notes about the HC-12 _off-the-shelf_.

## Components
The three main components of the HC-12 are:

- An [SILabs[


## SWIM/RST Pins
These are exposed as solder pads on the reverse of the board:

## SWIM
- The [STM8 SWIM] communication protocol is descibed at the link given.
- An Espressif ESP8266 based program for accessing the STM8's SWIM interface has been written by [rumpeltux/esp-stlink].

> Note that you cannot read the `HC-12` firmware directly using SWIM as it is read-protected.
